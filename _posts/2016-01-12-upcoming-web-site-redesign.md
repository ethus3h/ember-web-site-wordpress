I'm currently working on (yet another) design for the Web site. The screenshots in this post show what the new version looks like at the moment for various screen sizes.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It should be done reasonably soon (within a couple of weeks).

&nbsp;

I'll remove the "Old site" section, since it makes maintenance and backup difficult; I will replace it with links to the Internet Archive on 404 pages. No content should be lost, history-wise, since I will post the old site source code.

&nbsp;

I will write an update on what I'm doing after the redesign comes out, I think.

&nbsp;

It's dangerous on the roads around where I live now. Drive carefully and stay safe. Stay well.
